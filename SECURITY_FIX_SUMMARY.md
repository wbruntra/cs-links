# Security Validation Analysis and Fix

## Problem Identified
The Amazon URL was being rejected due to an overly strict pattern: `/%[0-9a-f]{2}/i` which flagged **any** percent-encoded characters, including legitimate ones like:
- `%C3%85` (UTF-8 encoded `Å`)
- `%20` (space)
- `%2C` (comma)

## Solution Implemented
Replaced the broad pattern with specific patterns that target only potentially dangerous percent-encoded characters:

### Old Pattern (Too Broad)
```javascript
/%[0-9a-f]{2}/i  // Blocked ALL percent-encoded chars
```

### New Patterns (Targeted)
```javascript
/%3[cC]/i, // %3C = <
/%3[eE]/i, // %3E = >
/%22/i,    // %22 = "
/%27/i,    // %27 = '
/%28/i,    // %28 = (
/%29/i,    // %29 = )
/%3[bB]/i, // %3B = ;
/%00/i,    // null byte
/%0[aA]/i, // %0A = newline
/%0[dD]/i, // %0D = carriage return
```

## Test Results
✅ **13/13 tests passed**
- Legitimate URLs with international characters, spaces, and valid encoding: **ALLOWED**
- Malicious URLs with XSS attempts, protocol violations, private IPs: **BLOCKED**

## Files Modified
- `routes/security.js` - Updated suspicious patterns
- `debug_security.js` - Debug script to analyze URL validation
- `test_security.js` - Comprehensive test suite

The security validation now properly balances security with usability, allowing legitimate e-commerce and international URLs while maintaining protection against common attack vectors.
